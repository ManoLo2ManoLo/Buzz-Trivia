Buzz Trivia

Introduction

Buzz Trivia was created for Project 1 and includes JavaScript, HTML, CSS files, and three APIs. The trivia app allows the user to take a break from their daily stresses. Buzz Trivia is a quiz app that allows the user to choose from 24 topics including: Sports, Computers, and Video Games among others. The user then can choose from three difficulties ranging from Easy, Medium and Hard. Each topic will provide the user with  10 multiple choice questions. At the end, the user will get a score, they will receive 10 points for each correct answer. The user will then be able to enter their name and record their high score.
