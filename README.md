# INTRODUCTION
Buzz Trivia was created for Project 1 and includes JavaScript, HTML, CSS files, and three APIs. The trivia app allows the user to take a break from their daily stresses. Buzz Trivia is a quiz app that allows the user to choose from 24 topics including: Sports, Computers, and Video Games among others. The user then can choose from three difficulties ranging from Easy, Medium and Hard. Each topic will provide the user with  10 multiple choice questions. At the end, the user will get a score, they will receive 10 points for each correct answer. The user will then be able to enter their name and record their high score. 

# USAGE
Once on Buzz trivia app the user will choose their desired topic, for example the user may choose Sports. The user will then be taken to a page where they will choose a difficulty level. If the user selects easy, the user will be brought to a page with the first of 10 questions. For each question the user will choose the answer they believe is correct. Once through all of the questions the user will get a score. They will be able to record their high score.
