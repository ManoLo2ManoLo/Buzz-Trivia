In this image, it displays an error message for quizes that may not have a quiz avaliable for that difficulty. Since we use a server side api, we dont not control which categories have certain difficulties readily avaliable. For Example math does not have an easy mode, but medium and hard are avaliable. But most categories have all three difficulties. This error page is displayed for those few instances.
